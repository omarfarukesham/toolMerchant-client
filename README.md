## FAQ

#### Q-01:  Can I use this app in commercial purpose ?

 Answer: No, this app only for development purpose, to promote market, certainly you
need to ensure some production technology, like payment getway. I am using this technology for developer api key, where you need, primenum key.

#### Q-02: May I add with developer protfolio ?
 Answer: yes you can, but to use this app you must 
 ensure .env varialbel without having this api key, you project will not work. Be careful when you will use it developer purpose.
 Thanks
